            <p>Kobe Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers
            franchise history. He was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons.
             His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time,
              while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star Game MVP Awards
              are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. </p>
              <p>He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became
                widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics,
                he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for
                 Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.</p>
